						<h2>The Seven Problems </h2>
					</header><!-- /.section__head -->

					<div class="section__content">
						<div class="list-numbers">
							<ol>
								<li>
									<h4>Everyone is chasing the same set of leads.</h4>

									<p>Have you heard of H--overs?<br> Of course, they have a database with 40+ million contacts, and probably thousands of customers.<br> Now is it a good thing? These thousands of customers are essentially chasing the same pool of leads.<br> So if you are an IT executive with budget authority, how many canned pitches you think you get a day? 10? 20? How about 30+?<br>So clearly this doesn’t work.</p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<h4>Generic sales pitches</h4>

									<p>I don’t know about you, but most of sales pitches I see go something along the lines: “Hey, IT executive! In case you need ______ , we are the best.”</p>

									<p>This is not personalized and not contextual.  Hence, it doesn’t work.</p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<h4>Lots of marketing activity, yet no results</h4>

									<p>According to Pareto law, no more than 20% of your leads will turn into clients. If your sales funnel is a little bit complex, this number<br>is actually lower – i.e. you lose 80% of leads at each step of your conversion funnel.</p>

									<p>Most of marketing activities that don’t recognize the context to identify and exploit sales trigger events, spent (i.e. waste) inordinate<br>amount of effort on leads who are obviously  in the “never gonna happen” pile. </p>

									<p>This leads to busy activity – emailing, social media’ing, promoting … with no readily measurable results. No accountability.<p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<h4>Marketing spent is not an investment but a liability</h4>

									<p>Here is the thinking… </p>

									<p>If I get pitched unskillfully by a certain person and company, I begin to transfer this negative impression onto this company’s product or service, thus diminishing the future chances of my ever becoming their client.</p>

									<p>In plain English: marketing and sales tools used incorrectly may not only NOT bring results, they can actually hurt your future sales.</p>
